I locally built the docker container and  installed the avr-gcc toolchain. After that I copied the whole toolchain to the host, so I can use the avr-gcc toolchain in my online codespace. Seems to be working.

Next I hope, that it is possible to somehow get access to the serial ports via Github Codespaces. I don't think, that this is possible at the time of writing.
